                title="Psychology Today looks at paraphilic disorder">paraphilic disorder</a>. There are several such
            disorders, with paraphilic referring to sexual interests, preferences, fantasies, urges, and behaviors
            outside the norm. These are considered symptoms of a disorder only if they are acted upon in ways that have
            the potential to cause distress or harm to oneself or others, especially non-consensual others.</p>
            <p>The individual normally experiences sexual arousal when spying intentionally on unsuspecting people. The
                person being watched may be naked, disrobing, or engaging in sexual activities. The voyeur may also
                record these acts for later viewing. Unintentional viewing of such acts is not considered voyeuristic
                disorder. Voyeurs are also known as “Peeping Toms,” who use binoculars, mirrors, and recording cameras
                while peering through peepholes and windows.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-9 reference__section--main"><h2 class="section__title">Symptoms</h2>
            <p>To be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder, a person must experience persistent and intense sexual arousal
                from the fantasy or act of watching an unsuspecting person who is naked, partially disrobed or sexually
                active, for at least six months. A subset of voyeurs derive sexual pleasure from watching people
                defecate or eavesdropping on highly erotic conversations. The viewer is likely to <a

                person. These behaviors must be causing severe distress or dysfunction in social, professional, or
                another significant area of the person’s day-to-day life. The viewer must be at least 18-years-old, and
                the viewing must occur without the other person’s consent. Males are more likely to engage in
                voyeuristic activities than females. Younger voyeurs are rarely arrested but adult voyeurism is a
                criminal act.</p>
            <p>Criteria include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Over a period of at least six months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from observ­ing an
                    unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity, as
                    manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
                </li>
                <li>The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a non-consenting person, or the sexual urges or
                    fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
                    important areas of functioning.
                </li>
                <li>The individual experiencing the arousal and/or acting on the urges is at least 18 years of age.</li>

        <div class="col-md-9 reference__section--main"><h2 class="section__title">Causes</h2>
            <p>No specific cause has been determined for voyeuristic disorder. However, certain risk factors tend to
                coincide with a person becoming a voyeur, including substance abuse, <a href="/us/basics/sexual-abuse"
                                                                                        class="inline-links topic-link"

                    abuse</a>, and being hypersexualized. Some experts suggest that, given the opportunity, many people
                have voyeuristic tendencies but are afraid to admit it or get caught. Voyeuristic disorder may stem from
                an accidental sighting of someone who is naked, disrobing, or participating in sexual activity.
                Continued viewing then reinforces and perpetuates the behavior to a point where it goes beyond what is
                considered culturally acceptable, or “normal,” and becomes pathological.</p>

            <p>Adult males with voyeuristic disorder often first become aware of their sexual interest in secretly

                However, the minimum age for a diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years because there is
                substantial difficulty in differentiating it from age-appropriate puberty-related sexual curiosity and
                activity. The persistence of voyeurism over time is unclear. Voyeuristic disorder, however, requires one
                or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without treatment: subjective distress

                act out sexually by spying on unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons. Therefore, the course of
                voyeuristic disorder is likely to vary with age.</p></div>

            <p>Voyeurs rarely submit themselves for treatment but may be referred by a parent, spouse, or the legal
                system when they are caught breaking the law. Treatment for voyeuristic disorder typically involves <a

                teaching the voyeur socially appropriate behaviors, such as respecting others’ privacy, and training
